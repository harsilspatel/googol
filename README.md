# googol
alfred workflow for opening google sites with specific user.

## Why
As someone who is alaways logged-in to mutliple gmail accounts at any given time, accessing a particular google service with desired account is painstakingly inconvenient and unproductive. This Alfred workflow is my attempt to address the problem.

## Commands
`g {service} {email}`

## to-do
- [ ] fuzzy search
- [ ] option to switch the arguments
- [ ] shortcut to execute the workflow
